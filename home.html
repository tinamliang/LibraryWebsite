<p>Greetings Colonel By Cougars! I am the Teacher-Librarian and also the Canada & World Studies Department Head at Colonel By.
  Everyone is welcome to come and discuss school work in the library and I will be happy to assist you. Please check out our Twitter
  @colbylibrary! We will keep you updated with news about books, films and world events! My teaching background is in History and
  Geography and I have had the opportunity to teach the academic/applied and IB courses offered at CB and at other schools in the OCDSB.
  Through the years I have also taught courses in Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology, World Religions, Civics, Careers, Business and
  Marketing. I love discussing politics and current events! I am looking forward to collaborating with your teachers on assignments and
  lessons and bringing in guest speakers. Do not hesitate to let me know of any titles that you feel should be added to our library. Our
  goal is to have a selection that is current and of interest to CB students!</p>

<p><b>Ms. Ladouceur</b></p>
<p>I have been working in school libraries since 1998. The love of reading drew me to this line of work. Before that I worked on Parliament
  Hill as assistant to cabinet ministers, then left to raise my children. Looking for a book recommendation, having problems with the printer
   or just looking to talk books I am here Tuesday, Thursday and every second Friday.</p>
