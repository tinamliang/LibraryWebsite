# LibraryWebsite

I created this for my school library's website and dabbled with a popular external web developer library known as **bootstrap**.

This website is continually updated, and new code is pushed periodically to this link, that is branched off from my school's main webpage: 
http://www.colonelby.com/teachers/library/

Here's an image of the homepage for some reference:

### Some features that I added:
    
    * Cleaner display / UI
    * Embedded Instagram / Twitter account that's automatically updated
